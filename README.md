# Cats_vs_Dogs

Cats vs Dogs is a 2 player game that takes part in a neighborhood yard, where a cat and a dog battle it out, to decide who is the boss.

Pygame Installation will be required.
The catsvsdogs.zip file contains all the necessary png and mp3 files that required in order to run the program.
This is a very basic pygame 2 player shooter game, that will allow each player to shoot up to a max of 3 shoots at a time, and will allocate 10 lives to each player (cat or dog).
A start and end screen will be added in the future, as well as possibly a change to the look of the health indicators.
